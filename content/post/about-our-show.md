## Overview
AI: Audience Interaction is an improv show written by Luke Gettings and Alon Heim. The show includes lots of dark humor, meta commentary, and of course, audience interaction.

The recommended age for the show is seven or older, as the show includes some violence, dark themes, and irreverent humor, as well as lots of nerdy computer-science humor that younger people may not understand.

People who want to see the show but do not want to participate in the "interaction" part of "audience interaction" will be allowed to opt out and sit back, relax, and watch everyone else have fun without them.

A date has not yet been confirmed for the show's performance. Why did I make a website for a show that is still in the writing phase and hasn't even been confirmed to have a showing? I was bored. That's why.

## Conception
AI was inspired by a Chicago play called *Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind* by Greg Allen and his troupe of Neo-Futurists. Alon and Luke participated in a production of this play for their school's drama club. The show had a very interesting format: 35 mini-plays that were two minutes long would be shuffled up and performed at random. The plays usually involved lots of meta humor and audience interaction. The two boys liked it so much that they wanted to write their own.

It all started one day in early 2023, the time where atificial intelligence was exploding in popularity, when Luke thought "Y'know, it'd be kinda funny if AI stood for 'audience interaction' instead of 'artificial intelligence.' He decided to open up a Google Doc and type out his ideas.

At school, he told his friend Alon about it, and he was interested in the concept. With him now having editor access, Alon began to write scenes at lighting speed. He wrote scenes in an interesting way: he would ask a classmate for the first word that came to their mind, with entries such as "airplane," "water bottle," and "random." He would proceed to write a scene about this topic. These words provided inspiration for many of the scenes, so in a way, the play was written by a plethora of students.
