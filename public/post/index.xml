      <description>Overview AI: Audience Interaction is an improv show written by Luke Gettings and Alon Heim. The show includes lots of dark humor, meta commentary, and of course, audience interaction.
The recommended age for the show is seven or older, as the show includes some violence, dark themes, and irreverent humor, as well as lots of nerdy computer-science humor that younger people may not understand.
People who want to see the show but do not want to participate in the &amp;ldquo;interaction&amp;rdquo; part of &amp;ldquo;audience interaction&amp;rdquo; will be allowed to opt out and sit back, relax, and watch everyone else have fun without them.</description>
